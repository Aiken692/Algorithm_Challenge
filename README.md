## How It Operates.
  
 So we can start by running the code through an engine.
 Then, It will ask you how many elements you want to Enter.
 When you enter the number like 6, it will require you to enter the different elements until they reach the maimum of 6,

 Then they will go through a series of loops to check for duplicates.
 Then will later print out the Distinct elements placed with out reapeating any .
